# Sokoban

## Overview

Sokoban is a computer game of the puzzle variety that was created in 1980, and is available on many computer platforms. The game involves controlling a worker in a warehouse who has to push boxes around the warehouse to get them onto their destination spots. The worker can only push one box at at time, and cannot pull boxes. It is easy for the player to get stuck in a deadlock where it is no longer possible to move some of the boxes. Some of the levels are extremely difficult to solve.

## Compiling Java files using Eclipse IDE

1. Download this repository as ZIP
2. Create new `Java Project` in `Eclipse`
3. Right click on your `Java Project` --> `Import`
4. Choose `General` --> `Archive File`
5. Put directory where you downloaded ZIP in `From archive file`
6. Put `ProjectName/src` in `Into folder`
7. Click `Finish`
8. Move all the files (not the directory) in the `images` and `levels` directory from `{ProjectName}/src` to the root of your `Java Project` i.e. `{ProjectName}`

### Linking the UI Library

9. Right click on your `Java Project` --> `Build Path` --> `Add External Archives`
10. Select `ecs100.jar` and link it to the project. That JAR will be in the directory where you downloaded ZIP

## Running the program

1. Right click on your `Java Project` --> `Run As` --> `Java Application` --> `Sokoban`

## Build an executable using IntelliJ IDEA

1. Go to **File** → **Project Structure** → **Artifacts**.
2. Click the green plus (**+**) button, select **JAR**, and choose **From modules with dependencies...**
3. In the **Main Class** field, click the folder icon and select the application's entry point class.
4. Under **JAR files from libraries**, select **extract to the target JAR** (this creates the single Fat JAR).
5. Click **OK**, then click **Apply**.
6. From the top menu bar, go to **Build** → **Build Artifacts...** and click **Build**.
7. The executable jar file will be generated inside the project directory under `out/artifacts/`.

### Run the executable JAR file using the command line:

```bash
java -jar path/to/executable.jar
```

### Loading Local Data

If you are trying to pick a file from your physical hard drive, you cannot browse your local folders through the Java window. You must use the bridge upload feature.

1. Look at the very top right of the Java window's title bar for a small **Up Arrow (Upload)** button.
2. Click it to trigger your **native browser file picker** (this one can see your real computer folders).
3. Select your local file. The app will silently drop it into the virtual folder named `/files/uploads/`.
4. Now, inside your Java file picker, type `/files/uploads/` into the file path bar and press **Enter** to find your uploaded file.


## Notes

<strong>Click on the graphics pane first to activate control using keys.</strong>

`WASD` or `IJKL` to move. You can also use `mouse-click` but this does NOT move boxes, just walks to that location if possible

## Features

- New Game = Picks new `level` from `<warehouse>N.txt` 
- Restart = Restarts current `level`

## Goal

 Put the boxes away in the designated area
